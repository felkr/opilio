    The one gym test that everyone hates. The overweight gym teacher slides in the CD, and you hear the dreaded words;

    The FitnessGramâ„¢ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it
    continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly,
    but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. beep A single lap should be completed each time you hear
    this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to
    complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready,
    start.
    You feel like it's easy at first.
    But you are so wrong.
    You run until you feel like you are going to die right there in the middle of the track, the same gym teacher
    yelling at you to keep going. But you just can't do it. You make it back to your partner and collapse, breathing
    heavily.
    "Dude, you only did like 20 laps."
    With the little strength you have left, you glare up at your partner, telling them to stfu
    "Oh, hey, we're having the fitnessgram pacer test!"
    *has war flashbacks*
